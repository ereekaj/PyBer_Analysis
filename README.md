# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the analysis: 

I've been working at PyBer, a ride-sharing app company. My co-worker Omar and I have been tasked to analyze ride sharing data from the company. Omar is out sick so I had to do the whole project myself! The purpose of the project is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and create a graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type. This information will be used to determine how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results: 

Below is a copy of the summary dataframe showing Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver for each type of city.

The data shows that Urban cities do the most volume of all the types of cities. They have the most rides, have the most drivers and have the highest total fares during the time period analyzed by a large margin. Urban cities have 68% of the rides, 81% of the drivers and 63% of the total fares. Suburban cites stats are much less than Urban cities but still more than Rurual with 26% of the rides, 16% of the drivers and 30% of the total fares. Rural cities have 5% of the rides, 3% of the drivers and 7% of the total fares. 

Surprisingly the data for average fare per ride and average fare per driver tells a different story.  Rural cities have the higher average fare per ride and per driver despite have less rides and drivers overall. Suburban cities are again middle of the road while Urban cities have the lowest average fares per ride and drivers. The difference between Rural cities and Urban cities for average fare per ride is $10.09 while the difference in average fare per driver is $38.92.  

The chart of fares by city type (shown below) confirms what the summary dataframe told us with Urban cities with the highest total fares, suburban cities in the middle and rural fares at the very bottom. The

## Summary: 

In summary, I have three business recommendations for the CEO based on the data presented. 

1. The volume of rides, drives and fares in urban cities is so large that we should look into opportunities to increase it even more.   

2. We should look into the correlation between the cities' populations and rides, drivers, and fares. Where a positive correlation exists, we can devote more resources in those types of cities to improve revenue. 

3. We should do some additional analysis on the distance traveled per ride and per driver. Because the average fare per ride and driver was highest in the rural and suburban cities over urban cities, I suspect that the distance between destinations is much longer in those types of cities resulting in longer rides and higher fares. There may be a revenue opportunities to make more money by advertising or other methods to increase ridership and recruit drivers.
