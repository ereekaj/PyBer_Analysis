# PyBer Analysis
##Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

I've been working at PyBer, a ride-sharing app company. My co-worker Omar and I have been tasked to analyze ride sharing data from the company. Omar is out sick so I had to do the whole project myself! The purpose of the project is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and create a  graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type. This information will be used to determine how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

##Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

##Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
